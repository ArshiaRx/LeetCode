# LeetCode Solutions (Auto-Synced)

This repository automatically syncs my **Accepted** LeetCode submissions into GitHub using a scheduled GitHub Actions workflow.

## Structure

Solutions are organized by difficulty:

- `leetcode/Easy/`
- `leetcode/Medium/`
- `leetcode/Hard/`

Each problem folder typically follows:

`{question_id}-{title_slug}`

## Language Usage Analysis

A language distribution report is generated automatically:

- `leetcode/ANALYSIS.md` (human-readable)
- `leetcode/analysis.json` (machine-readable)

## Notes

- Only **Accepted** submissions are synced.
- The workflow does **not** include problem statements (to avoid copyright/DMCA issues).
- Sync runs on a schedule and can also be triggered manually in the Actions tab.
